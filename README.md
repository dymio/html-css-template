HTML and CSS Template
=====================

Version 1.0, April 14, 2014

This is template for web project frontend. It includes:

- HTML valid document with all necessary tags in the head tag and some tips;
- CSS basis and tricks for easy start any project (based on Normalize, Bootstrap and my own works);
- humans.txt example file;
- robots.txt example file;
- sitemap.xml example file;
- set of favicons in (almost) all resolutions that are necessary;

I reccomend to minimize and compile css styles to one file before using in static project. Ruby on Rails frameworks and many others have automatical precompiler.

Browsers support
----------------

IE 8+, Firefox 4+, Safari 5+, Opera, Chrome

Used components
---------------

- [Normalize.css](http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) as styles base
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as source of many good decisions and design
